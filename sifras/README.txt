                        Simple PHP Framework for Students
================================================================================

SiFraS is an Open Source very simple framework to study about MVC pattern.
But that does not mean it can not be used in a real application.


FEATURES
--------

- Comes with PHPMailer and a ready to use sendHtmlEmail(...) function.
- has an html generator for tables and forms.
- A model class to abstract database access.
- Due to MVC pattern, applications can be done in a modular way. See the 
  customer_base example.


INSTALLATION
------------

1. Download the SifraS_x_x_x.zip and unpack in your server directory.
2. Create a database for the application and load the sifras.sql.
3. Config the file config/localconf.php for your database settings.
4. Ok, now you can access with a browser.



DO NOT CHANGE SiFraS files
--------------------------

Is not recomended that you change the original SiFras file. If you do that,
you may not be able to update your SiFras version to a new one.

If you need to change SiFras, pls let me now. Then I can check what SiFras can
do for you.

Any changes made in original files, must be documented for yourself, then you can
transfer the changes for a new version.
